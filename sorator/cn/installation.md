# Installation

- - -

You can install Orator in 2 different ways:
- The easier and more straightforward is to use pip
```
pip install orator
```

- Install from source using the official repository (https://github.com/sdispater/orator)

The different dbapi packages are not part of the package dependencies, so you must install them in order to connect to corresponding databases:
- PostgreSQL: psycopg2
- MySQL: PyMySQL or mysqlclient
- SQLite: The sqlite3 module is bundled with Python by default
